# ilog
This uses jquery, DataTables and Bootstrap to allow you to search a mysql database with syslog messages.  The search is very fast and uses server side processing.  I built a database and table for the logs.  I then used syslog-ng to send the logs to mysql database.  All .js and .css files needed are in the isyslog directory.
